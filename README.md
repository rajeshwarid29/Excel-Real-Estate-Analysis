**Title: Terro’s real estate agency Analysis**

**Problem Statement (Situation):**

**“Finding out the most relevant features for pricing of a house”**

Terro’s real-estate is an agency that estimates the pricing of houses in a certain locality. The pricing is
concluded based on different features / factors of a property. This also helps them in identifying the
business value of a property. To do this activity the company employs an “Auditor”, who studies
various geographic features of a property like pollution level (NOX), crime rate, education facilities
(pupil to teacher ratio), connectivity (distance from highway), etc. This helps in determining the price
of a property. The agency has also provided a dataset of 506 houses in Boston for which we'll have to do analysis. 

**Objective (Task):**

To analyze the magnitude of each variable to which it can affect the price of a house in a particular locality using various statistical/analytical tools in MS Excel like Summary
statistics, Histogram, correlation table, Regression analysis (using Data analysis tool pack) & implementing EDA .

**Result:**

•	Performed summary statistics, histograms, correlation matrices, and regression analysis to facilitate understanding and decision-making in real estate pricing.

•	Developed a statistically significant regression model (p < 0.05), explaining 69.36% of the variance in house prices.
